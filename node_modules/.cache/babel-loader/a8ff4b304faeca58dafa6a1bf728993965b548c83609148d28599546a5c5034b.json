It was held at Jos\\xE9 Guadalupe Zuno Hern\\xE1ndez Park in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico. There were 70 attendees consisting of families and individuals from around Guadalajara, with 45 adults and 25 kids. This program was conducted at Jos\\xE9 Guadalupe Zuno Hern\\xE1ndez Park in Jalisco. The camp started off with a few ice breaker games which attendees enjoyed. There were many new faces for everyone, so these games provided a fun way to get to know each other. These were followed by a lesson on a few powerful shlokas to recite daily. A song (Dharma Ke Liye Jiye), was sung to set the mood and bring positive energy to all. After this, many games were played. Adults played together and kids played in their own group. Some games that the adults enjoyed were Kho-kho, Hanuman (Human chess), and Airplane. Some games that the children enjoyed were Vish Amrut (Poison & Nectar) and Crocodile Tag. The games were followed by an informative yoga session for both, children and adults. Surya Namaskars (Sun Salutations) were taught with proper forms and many were interested in learning this form of yoga. After practicing yoga, attendees participated in learning various forms of pranayam, or breathing excercises. They learned a few forms including, Bastrika, Kapal Bhati, Anulom Vilom, and Omkar chanting. The yoga and pranayam was followed by an engaging discussion for the adults/parents about how to preserve and pass on cultural heritage and teachings to the next generation. A fun interactive story about Shri Hanuman ji was told to the kids which they enjoyed a lot. To wrap the program up, attendees were taught the meaning of the Prarthana we recite. Everyone repeated the first two, and last stanza of the prarthana and felt inspired. Many expressed their joy and gratitude that such type of event was conducted and that they were looking forward to coming again on a regular basis. Many parents felt this to be a good place to take their kids while also getting a chance to meet others in a fun and engaging way.
